I'm sure I've misunderstood some basic concepts, but hey, at least something is working. ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting started\r\n===============\r\n\r\n1. Download the **node.js** dependencies:\r\n\r\n\t\tnpm update\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Download and install [compass](http://compass-style.org/install/).\r\n\r\n\t\tgem update --system\r\n\t\tgem install compass\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Compile sass to css\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tcompass compile web/\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Start the node server.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tnode dev-server.js\r\n\r\n\r\n5.
